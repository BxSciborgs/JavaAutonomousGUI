# Java Autonomous GUI

### A path generating and realtime positioning tool made for the SciBorgs

This tool can generate paths with a custom AutonomousRoutine object which can
be loaded from the robot during the math. The autonomous routines contain path
information and actions to be performed at each node in the path (e.g. place
cube on scale, pick up cube).

This tool also has the ability to get position information from the robot and
display the robot's position on the screen during the match. The implementation
can be improved and it wasn't used during the 2018 season it was developed for,
but it may be finshed for the 2019 season.

This tool was developed for the Bronx Science SciBorgs (1155) for the 2018 FRC
season to make setting up the autonomous routine faster and easier.
